# AuraSR-App

A quick and lightweight server to try out AuraSR. Built using FastHTML. App was coded using Claude, see initial_prompt.md for what that was, and then had it make a few tweaks from there to get to its current form. You can read more about it on my blog [here](https://dysondunbar.com/Dailies/FastHTML-and-AuraSR-V2-(2024-08-02)).
